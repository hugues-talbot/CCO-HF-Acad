	\section{Normals and curvature}
	
	There is a deep link between the evolution of the normal along a curve and the curvature.
	
	Let $C$ be a planar curve. To define the curvature at a point, we can consider
	the case of a straight line. We can admit that in this case the curvature is zero along the line. For a portion of a circle, the curvature is defined to be inversely proportional to the radius of the circle:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\kappa = \frac{1}{R}
	\end{equation}
	
		\begin{figure}

			\caption{The notion of an osculating circle (best local approximation) defines the curvature as the inverse of the radius of the circle.\label{fig:oscul}}
		\end{figure}
	
	More precisely, for any curve, we can locally approximate a sufficiently regular curve (${\cal C}^2$ is enough) at a point by a circle that best approximates it locally (see Fig.~\ref{fig:oscul}. This circle is tangent to $C$ and is called an {\em osculating circle}. The radius of this circle defines the curvature.
	

	
	Another way to define the curvature is to consider a point moving at a constant speed along the curve $C$. The variation of the tangent vector along the curve defines the curvature. This is equivalent to specifying the acceleration of the point.
	
	
	\begin{equation}
	\kappa = \frac{d \mathbf{T}}{ds},
	\end{equation}
	
	where $s$ is a parametrisation of the curve. Both definition of the curvature
	are in fact equivalent (see Fig.~\ref{fig:theta}). 
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Drawings/theta.pdf}
		\caption{We can write $\sin d\theta \approx d\theta = \frac{ds}{R}$. As ds tends to zero, we have $R = \frac{d\theta}{ds} = \frac{d \mathbf{T}}{ds}$.\label{fig:theta}}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	\section*{Parametrisation}
	
	Let $\gamma(t)$ be a parametrisation of the curve $C$, i.e.
	
	\begin{equation}
	\gamma(t) = (x(t),y(t))
	\end{equation}
	
	This defines the position of a point on the curve over time. We assume an injective parametrisation, i.e. such that
	the speed $\gamma'(t)$ is never zero. This means 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\forall t, \|\gamma'(t)\|^2 = x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2 > 0 
	\end{equation}
	
	In this case, we can re-paramametrise the curve with curvilinear abcissa $s$ in such a way that the speed is constant and equal to one.
	
	\begin{equation}
	\forall s, \gamma'(s)^2 = x'(s)^2 + y'(s)^2 = 1
	\end{equation} 
	
	In this parametrisation, $\gamma'$ is the unit tangent velocity vector $\mathbf{T}$. If $\mathbf{N}$ is the unit normal vector to the curve, we have
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{T}'(s) = \kappa(s)\mathbf{N}(s)
	\end{equation}
	
	We note that instead of deriving the unit tangent vector, we can also consider deriving the unit normal vector. This is because $\mathbf{N}$ is $\mathbf{T}$ rotated by $\frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e. $\mathbf{N}(x,y) = (-y'(s),x'(s))$. This yields
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{N}'(s) = \kappa(s)\mathbf{T}(s)
	\end{equation}
	
	We will make use of that fact in the next section.
	
	\section*{Level sets}
	
	In imaging it can be difficult to represent a parametric curve because of discretization effects. It is common to
	represent it by a {\em level set} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:level_set}).
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Images/Level_set_method.jpg}
		\caption{Representing a curve by a level set.\label{fig:level_set}}
	\end{figure}
	
	Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a ${\cal C}^2$ function in a domain $\Omega$. We define the curve $\Gamma$ as the zero-level-set of this function
	
	\begin{equation}
	\Gamma = \{(x,y), \phi(x,y) = 0\}
	\end{equation}
	
	$\Gamma$ is a set and no longer a parametrized curve, however we can manipulate it by working on the underlying $\phi$ function. This is the main idea behind the level-set method~\cite{Sethian-level-sets-1999}.
	

	
	\section*{Level sets and curvature}
	
	Curvature is easy to define in the level set case. For any point $(x,y)$ in $\Omega$, $\nabla \phi (x,y)$ is the gradient at $(x,y)$. If we consider the level-set at $(x,y,\phi(x,y))$, i.e. the curve that passes through $(x,y)$ at level $\phi(x,y)$, 
	then $\nabla \phi(x,y)$ is the normal vector to this curve at $(x,y)$. The unit normal is given by
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{n}(x,y) = \frac{\nabla \phi}{|\nabla \phi|}(x,y)
	\end{equation}
	
	The curvature is given by the derivative of this expression. However this is a multidimensional derivative. Since $\nabla \phi$ is a vector, we must use the divergence operator:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\kappa = \nabla . \frac{\nabla \phi}{|\nabla \phi|}
	\end{equation}
	
	This is in particular true for the computation of the curvature of $\Gamma$.

	\section{Application to our problem}
	
We want to define how to sample a segment $p_1p_2$ so that checking at each sampling point if it is located outside the perfusion territory, we can conclude the segment belongs inside the territory or not. The number of checking ($n + 1$), shall be optimized in order to avoid too many tests (minimize computation time) but also to guarantee the result with a tolerance reasonable enough (maximize test accuracy).

	\subsection{First approach} \label{firstaproach}

We can estimate $n$, the number of tests along the segment, from:
\begin{equation}
n \propto \frac{|p_1 - p_0|}{R}
\end{equation}
$R$ is an approximation of the local curvature along the segment by estimating the divergence at each point $p_1$ and $p_2$, called $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively :
\begin{equation}
R = max(|R_1|, |R_2|)
\end{equation} 
The figure \ref{example} illustrates the relationship between $D = |p_1 - p_0|$, $R_1$, $R_2$ and $n$. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Drawings/CurvatureTestExample.png}
\caption{When $D$ gets bigger relatively to $max(|R_1, R_2|)$, the value of $n$ is also higher to detect if the segment crosses the perfusion territory.}
\label{example}
\end{figure}

The divergence of a a continuously differentiable vector field $\omega$ is equal to the scalar value function:
\begin{equation}
div (\omega) = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}) \cdot (\omega_x, \omega_y) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
div (\omega) = \left( \omega_x(x, y) - \omega_x(x-1, y) \right) + \left( \omega_y(x, y) - \omega_y(x, y - 1) \right)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\omega_x = \nabla_x \omega = \omega (x + 1, y) - \omega (x, y)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\omega_y = \nabla_y \omega = \omega (x, y + 1) - \omega (x, y)
\end{equation}	

\subsection{Second approach}

We are in the case of measuring the curvature along a segment, so we could use the segment information within an iterative process.

We calculate the distances $\lambda_i$ that solves:
\begin{equation}
\omega (p_1) + \lambda_1 <\nabla \omega(p_1), \overset{\rightarrow}{p_1p_2}> = 0 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\omega (p_2) + \lambda_2 <\nabla \omega(p_2), \overset{\rightarrow}{p_1p_2}> = 0
\end{equation}

and then select:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \min(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)
\end{equation}
to obtain :
\begin{equation}
n = \operatorname{ceiling}(\frac{1}{\lambda})
\end{equation}
We keep in mind that this method would fail for any case where the dot product $<\nabla \omega(p_1), p_1p_2> simeq 0$, and in some specific situations such as the figure x, so we define a global boundary:
\begin{equation}
n \geq \frac{||p_1p_2||}{2R_{\text{max}}}
\end{equation}
with $R_{max}$ the maximal curvature radius of both inner and outer surfaces.\\

This equation does not look correct to me: you are adding a potential value to a scalar which has nothing to do with a potential.
You actually don't test if the line defined by the segment $p_1p_2$ crosses a concavity, which actually might not happen!

If we want to find the first point along the gradient direction, starting from $p_1$, that reaches the border of the perfusion territory we look for $lambda$ that solves:
\begin{equation}
\omega( p_1 + \lambda \nabla w(p_1)) = 0
\end{equation}
This can also be written as:
\begin{equation}
\omega(p_1) + \lambda ||\nabla w(p_1)|| = 0
\end{equation}

If $\lambda$ is small, $p_1$ is close to a concavity. 
Then we can use its projection on the segment $p_1p_2$ to determine if the segment is how fast the segment is going toward the concavity.
\begin{equation}
 d_{proj} = \frac{< \lambda \nabla \omega(p_1), p_1p_2>}{||p_1p_2||}
\end{equation}
This distance $d_{proj}$ is efficient to sample the segment, so $n$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
n = ceiling(\frac{||p_1p_2||}{d_{proj}})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
n = ceiling(\frac{1}{< \lambda \nabla \omega(p_1), p_1p_2>})
\end{equation}

%\end{figure}


This method is expected to be more accurate than the previous one \ref{firstaproach}, because it considers the potential along the segment (not only at the tips), but also both local and global curvature.
